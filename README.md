# Zoom ActionKIt (ZAKI) Server

The purpose of this project is to handle the  step in between connecting Zoom and ActionKit to allow bidirectional server communicaton between the two services.

It exists as a simple RESTFul service that can be able to do the following:

1. List events from a particular campaign on ActionKit.
2. Create events via the ActionKit POST endpoint.
3. Create webinars via the Zoom POST endpoint.
4. List webinars via the Zoom GET endpoint.

The scope of this is continuously growing and as such will change throughout the scope of development.


More docs comming soon.
